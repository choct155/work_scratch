    "In an attempt to develop a proxy for Medicaid program generosity (see **`mcaid_by_state`**), it became clear that NIPA data conflicted with other sources.  Specifically, some states had wildly different data from the information presented by [KFF](http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/total-medicaid-spending/#), which is based on Form CM-64 data reported by states to CMS.  To some extent, we have limited recourse.  Before 1997, we NIPA is the only consolidate source of Medicaid spending by state.  However, CMS has made data available from 1997 on.\n",
