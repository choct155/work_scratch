#Theory of Taxation

This space is just a place for scratch work while working through some ideas in tax.  Some of it will likely be fairly basic, in an effort to provide Notebooks I can pass along at a later date.

This collection is inspired by Louis Kaplow's [*The Theory of Taxation and Public Economics*](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8656.html), which has the distinction of being the first text I have come across that has presented an analytic approach with such broad application (at least it seems to do so thus far).  It is particularly interesting given the explicit recognition of measurement from a common denominator, which it turns out is kind of a big deal in my line of work (at CBO).
